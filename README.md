# GraziosoSalvare

This project involves working as a junior software developer at Global Rain on a software solution for Grazioso Salvare, an international search and rescue animal training company. 
You'll modify the existing Driver.java class and create a new Monkey.java class. 
Your tasks include following industry best practices, implementing input validation, and ensuring clarity and consistency in your code. 
The Monkey class must inherit from RescueAnimal and meet specification attributes, while the Driver class requires modifications to the main() method and the implementation of methods to intake, reserve, and print animal details from ArrayLists.
This project showcases your object-oriented programming skills and adherence to industry standards.
